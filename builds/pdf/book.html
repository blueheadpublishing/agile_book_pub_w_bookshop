    <h1>Instant Gratification</h1>
    <p>Since we profess to be an agile shop, we want to put our money where our mouth is - well, it's open source, so instead of money we'll just say mojo. Rather than walking you through an entire conceptual framework and working through diagrams, lets just jump into the code and take a quick look around.</p>
    <p>In this chapter we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a new book project</li>
      <li>Take a look around and see where things are</li>
      <li>Talk about the master book.html.erb file</li>
      <li>Build some books in different formats</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section">
      <h1>Creating a New Book</h1>
      <p>We are going to walk you through the development of a book in Bookshop by looking at a very simple example of a book. And best of all, it already comes bundled in Bookshop as part of your installation. You can use it as a point of reference when you are building a new book.</p> 
      <p>So let's go ahead. Issue 'bookshop new example'</p>
      <p>You should see a list of things being built. Here's a basic breakdown:</p>
      
      <p>.gitignore - Tells git what not to version
        book/
        builds/
        config/
        script/</p>
        
      <p>The book folder is where you book's source lives. All of the code to build all of the different types of formats will be stored here.</p>
      <p>The builds folder is where all of the different builds will be saved, like the PDF, mobi, epub, etc. Each time a new build is built, the old builds are deleted and new ones are placed in the file.</p>
      <p>The config folder is where all of the configuration for bookshop and your book live, like the book data (more on that later) and the config file for bookshop.</p>
      <p>The script folder is where the bookshop script lives.</p>
